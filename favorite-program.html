  <p>The program I made dissected lyrics of a song. It's output showed how frequently each word showed up in a song that was the input.</p>
  <p>Shown below are some lines of the code that I wrote with the comments included.</p>
</div>

<pre>
  <code>
    # converts lyrics into lower case
    lyrics_lower = lyrics.lower()

    # replaces all occurances of commas with a blank
    # ended up not needing to use a loop since there was only commas to remove
    lyrics_lower_update = lyrics_lower.replace(',', '')

    # creates a list of the words in the song
    words = lyrics_lower_update.split()

    # seperates the lines of the song
    lines = lyrics_lower_update.splitlines()

    # counts lines of the song
    line_count = len(lines)

    # found this bit of code on stack overflow in a forum post,
    # it creates a dictionary of the song lyrics and the counts how many times each word occurs
    from collections import Counter
    words_in_song = Counter(words)

    # counts the amount of unique words are in the song
    unique_words = len(words_in_song)

    # displays the information about unique words and line count for the user
    print(f'There are {unique_words} unique words and {line_count} lines in Pumped Up Kicks by Foster The People.')
